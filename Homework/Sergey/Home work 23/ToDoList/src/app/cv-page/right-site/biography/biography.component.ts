  biography = `I am Sergey Masalsky, I was born on May 8, 1991 in the Republic of Belarus, the city of Soligorsk. In 1998, I went to high school â„– 2 in the city of Pinsk. In 2009, he graduated from high school and entered the Belarusian National Technical University at the Faculty of Construction. I studied industrial and civil engineering. At university I was for the first time acquainted with programming, which followed me for 5 years. After graduating from the university I went to work as a foreman at a construction site. Over the next 8 years I rose to the position of site manager. But all that time my friends were going into programming next to me, one by one, so I began to think, especially because I was good at coding in old programming languages. And the work at the construction site has recently ceased to bring both pleasure and decent wages. So I decided to try and change the direction of my further development. I decided to study at the IT Academy "STEP". That's actually how I ended up here, I hope that everything will work out and I will change the construction site to the world of programming. I also plan to start learning English in the near future.`;
